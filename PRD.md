- **Task Categorization:** Organize tasks into 'personal' and 'professional' categories.
- **Mark as Complete:** Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- **Batch Translation:** Translate all visible tasks into a language of the user's choice using Google Translate API.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean, modern interface accessible on desktop and mobile.

## 3. User Stories
- As a user, I want to sign up and log in so that my tasks are private and personalized.
- As a user, I want to add, edit, and delete tasks so I can manage my to-do list.
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so I can track my progress.
- As a user, I want to organize tasks by category so I can separate personal and professional items.
- As a user, I want to translate all my tasks into another language so I can use the app in my preferred language.

## 4. Technical Requirements
- **Backend:** Flask (Python), SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon or similar cloud provider)
- **Authentication:** Flask-Login
- **Translation:** Google Translate API (unofficial, via `translate.googleapis.com`)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Deployment:** Vercel (serverless)
- **Environment Variables:**
  - `DATABASE_URI` for database connection
  - `SECRET_KEY` for Flask session security

---

## 5. Success Criteria
- All core features (auth, CRUD, translation) work as described
- App is accessible via a public URL
- Code is well-documented and open source
- User and developer documentation is provided
- Loom video walkthrough is available

---

## 6. Out of Scope
- Real-time collaboration
- File uploads/attachments
- Mobile app (web only)

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
- **API Rate Limits:** Google Translate API is unofficial and may be rate-limited. Mitigate by caching translations or switching to a paid API if needed.
- **Serverless Cold Starts:** Vercel functions may have cold starts. Mitigate by keeping functions lightweight.
- **Database Connectivity:** Ensure environment variables are set correctly and use a reliable cloud database provider.
